      <p>
        Today is 31st October 2023, and I have completed 7 days of Semen
        Retention today. I am feeling some extra little energy in my body. And
        as I am going through day, I am feeling that energy. I am able to use
        that energy to put more efforts into the activity, whether it is gyming
        or studying. Today I had good sleep of around 8 Hours so I am feeling
        energetic and fresh. I want to do something, I want to do some creative
        activities. I am feeling that I can sit for longer hours to study. I am
        doing 30 minutes sessions so I am feeling that it is achievable so I can
        sit for longer hours. This is good feeling. I am feeling good.
